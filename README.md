## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my project.

** This challenge is about using REST API with Ajax method. I used free wheather api key to have instant weather conditions of any location in the world. 
Then transformed it into celcius together with some icons like sun, rain, cloud **

**I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes.**

**Thanks for watching!** ðŸš€
